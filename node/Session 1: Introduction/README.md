#### Introduction of TDD
&nbsp; &nbsp; TDD is an innovative software development approach/process(test first) where tests are written, before writing the minimum of code required for the test to be fulfilled.

&nbsp; The process/approach where test drive development rather then requirements drive development. This is the process of adding one extra layer for developer on the top of your application to validate your production code. 

#### TDD workflow
- Create Test.
- Run test.
- The test should fail.
- Write minimal code to pass the test.
- Refactor the code.

#### Benefits of implementing automated unit test on your project.
- Clean code
- Reusability & modular code
- Quick Feedback Loop
- Confident during refactor/version update
