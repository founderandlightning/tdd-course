# TDD Session 2
In this session, we are going to discuss few things at beginner level like why we need to write UNIT Test? How to configure/write unit test with popular testing framework along with the introduction of TDD.



### Focus Points
- Introduction, Benefits of writing unit test case on your project.
- Famous TDD FWs.
- General setup.
- Basic configurations
- Guidelines.
- Example of **UNIT TESTING**

### Introduction of TDD, Unit Test and benefits of unit Test.

**TDD** : **T**est **D**riven **D**evelopment is an innovative software development approach/process where tests are written, before writing the minimum of code required for the test to be fulfilled. 

**UNIT TESTING** : Unit Testing is a level of software testing where individual units/components of a software are tested through testing framework.

#### Benefits of Unit Testing
- Quality of Code
- Finds Software Bugs Early
- Refactor Code
- Provides Documentation
- More confident when you refactor

<hr/>

### Famous TDD FWs.
- **Phpunit :** Because it is basic and starting from basic is easy. It is mature and very popular and thatâ€™s why good documentation, lot of tutorials and lot of threads on Q&A boards and on forums.

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Official website: https://phpunit.de/ </p>


- **CodeCeption :** BDD-style PHP testing framework, it was more than basic, but can be used for different sort of testing.

<hr/>


### Setup of PhpUnit.
- 
```wget https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit-6.0.phar
chmod +x phpunit-6.0.phar
sudo mv phpunit-6.0.phar /usr/local/bin/phpunit
phpunit --version


```
- composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit ^6.0


<hr/>

### Configuration

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<phpunit colors="true" stopOnFailure="false">
    <testsuites>
        <testsuite name="Application Test Suite">
            <directory suffix="Test.php">./tests</directory>
        </testsuite>
    </testsuites>
    <filter>
        <whitelist processUncoveredFilesFromWhitelist="true">
            <directory suffix=".php">./app</directory>
        </whitelist>
    </filter>
    <php>
        <env name="APP_ENV" value="testing"/>
        <env name="DB_CONNECTION" value="sqlite_testing"/>
        <env name="DB_DATABASE" value=":memory:"/>
        <env name="CACHE_DRIVER" value="array"/>
        <env name="SESSION_DRIVER" value="array"/>
        <env name="QUEUE_DRIVER" value="sync"/>
    </php>
</phpunit>

```

### General assertions in TDD

- assertTrue($param)

- assertFalse($param)

- assertEqual($expected,$actual)

### Guidelines

- No if condition in test case
- Never write code before unit test
- Test should be independent
- No DB transaction
- Do not write negative case only

### My first test

```

<?php
namespace Tests\Unit;
use Tests\ParentTestClass;

class SampleTest extends ParentTestClass
{
	public function testHelloWorld() {
		$this->assertTrue(true);
		$this->assertFalse(false);
		$this->assertEquals(10, 10);
	}
}
```

Have a look into below image how unit test should work on your production code.
